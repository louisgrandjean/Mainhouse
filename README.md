* Walkthrough

Welcome to mainHouse, a welcoming app designed to help Agencies and Owners to interract with each other.
First, you get to the landing page, where you can try to understand what we intend to do here. You'll see a few "calls to action" that will lead you directly
to the Agency "sign-in" form. There, you can type the matching LOGIN and the PASSWORD to gain acces to our app. 

The first thing you'll see is your main view as an Agency : the Builing index. Feel free to roam through them, discovering the many features we have in store. 
Each Building is editable or deletable, and you can of course create one of your own, in the case where your agency would acquire one. 

In the Building show page, you'll be able to either : 
  - try and chat with Owners on the Building Chat
  - consult, create or edit Events for the same Building
  - add a new Owner to the said building (an action that will automatically send an email to said Owner, inviting him to the website)

Of course, most of these actions are accessible via the Sidebar you'll discover on the left. 
On the far bottom of it, you'll see that you can go to your own profile, and edit it, or delete it in worste case scenarios.
Finally, the Sign-out button will lead you back to the Landing page.

From there, you can again log in, this time with your Owner LOGIN, the password remaining the same. 
If, by any chance, you previously added an Owner, as an Agency, to the database : check his email, and you'll get directions as to how to log in with your brand new Owner profile.
That being said, once logged in, you can check the Owner side of our app, with more limited actions, but still entitled to the Events and Chat.
As a matter of fact, you only own a building, or part of it, and so : your actions are bound to it. 
Still, there is one action that only you can perform : editing your profile. One of the privileges of being an Owner using mainHouse.

We hope you enjoy your stay in our little app, and to see you again very soon for more real-estate related README files !

Truly yours,

MKDev
